Using our IDVKey API, you will be able to easily integrate IDVKey's capabilities with your website and services (even offline services like for example authenticating a user over the phone).

In order to integrate with IDVKey, we provide a [REST API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer),
as well as various Software Development Kits (SDK) that will allow you to very easily use those APIs.

We currently provide SDKs for the following platforms/applications:

* [Java](idvkey-sdk-java/index.html), with a [JSF-based example website](https://github.com/Kloudtek/idvkey-sdk/tree/master/examples/jsf)
* PHP (soon)

More SDKs will be implemented in the future based on demand, feel free to add a request in the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/Kloudtek/idvkey-sdk/issues) for your favorite platform/application,
as we'll use that in order to prioritise new SDKs implementations.

Alternatively should you wish to implement your own REST integration, you'll find documentation
and specs in the [API section](api/index.html)

The following operations are currently provided in the API

| Operation        | Overview                                                  | Linking required         | Default Timeout  |
| ---------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------:| ---------------- |
| Authentication   | Authenticate a user (automatically links him if required) |                          | 5 mins           |
| Approval         | Request a user to approve something                       | <span
        class="icon-ok"/>  | 5 mins           |
| Link User        | Request a user to approve linking to your service (this is generally not needed unless you wish to use IDVKey without user authentication)  | | 5 mins   |

See [Using IDVKey APIs](using-apis.html) for more details on those API operations
